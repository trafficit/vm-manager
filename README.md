# vm-manager
VM_manager.py is a lightweight GUI tool designed to automate the startup and shutdown of VirtualBox
virtual machines. It provides a clean interface with exclusive visual styling, allowing users to manage 
lab environments with precision and ease.

This program was built to support the hands-on penetration testing labs inspired by the work of Royce Davis,
author of The Art of Network Penetration Testing. It streamlines the process of launching virtual machines 
used in lab scenarios, making it ideal for students, professionals, and enthusiasts working through Royceâ€™s methodology.
